### Getting Started

- To get started, scroll down and click Add to begin building your fleet! Just make sure to pick squares next to each other (Vertically or Horizontally).
- Once your fleet is built, you can start playing the game by picking a square on the Computer's board to attack.
- The Computer will immediately strike back, and you continue this process until someone's fleet is completely sunk!
